# Midterm Feedback
The midterm feedback will be very similar to what you receive on a weekly basis for the homework, but more specific for each problem in this case.

## Final Score: 62/50


### Step 1: Priest Score Calculation
* **5pts** - Your code computed the correct probability and returned it
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 2: Find a Hospital
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the correct hospital given the inputs using requests
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 3: Get the Hospital Address
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the JSON file, parsed it, and looked up the hospital
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 4: Process List of Patients
* **10pts** - Your code correctly fetched the psv file, looped through it, and ran your other functions
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for

### Step 5: Compare Results
* **5pts** - Your code looped through all the results and compared them to the provided key
  * **(-3 pts) - I don't see how your code compares the data in the test file and your results.  You seem to be comparing the keys to make sure the same keys are in both, but I don't see you comparint the data values, especially the Hospital Name and Address**

### Extra Credit
* Up to 15 pts based on correctness and quality of the extra credit step
* **(+15 pts) Nicely done**

### Coding Best Practices:
**3 pts** - Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?

* **In part 1, your choice to write many of the decimals as `(18/100)` is strange. It requires more typing and it is kind of confusing to read.  If there's a reason you did it that way instead of `0.18`, I'm interested to understand your thinking.**
